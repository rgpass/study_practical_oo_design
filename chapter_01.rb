# OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN
# Start to shift your thought pattern from a list of events to
# objects that interact with each other.
# Ex: Instead of wife steps on the cat and the cat runs away,
# you have: wife.steps(cat)

# The purpose of OOD is not to predict future features
# but to structure the code in such a way that upgrades
# and changes are easy.

# Most well-known design PRINCIPLES are SOLID, DRY, and Law
# of Demeter.
# (S) Single-Responsibility
# (O) Open-Closed
# (L) Liskov Substitution
# (I) Interface Segregation
# (D) Dependency Inversion

# There are also design PATTERNS written by the Gang of Four
# The point of design patterns are to provide "simple and
# eloquent solutions to specific problems in OO software
# design" that you can use to "make your own designs more 
# flexible, modular, reusable and understandable."

# This book is not about patterns, but sets you up to
# understand the patterns and when to use them appropriately.

# Agile works because it acknowledges that certainty is 
# unattainable in advance of the application’s existence; 
# Agile’s acceptance of this truth allows it to provide 
# strategies to overcome the handicap of developing software 
# while knowing neither the target nor the timeline.

# The ultimate metric for software is:
# cost per feature over the time interval that matters
